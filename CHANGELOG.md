# Changelog

All notable changes to TetraMem-XL are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [5.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added — Tetrahedral Cell Decomposition + Honeycomb Structural Analysis + Enhanced Memory Placement

#### TetrahedralCell
- Explicit tetrahedral cell data structure for each BCC decomposition unit
- 4 quality metrics per cell: Volume, Quality (regularity), Skewness, Jacobian
- Volume: |det(v1-v0, v2-v0, v3-v0)| / 6
- Quality: volume ratio vs ideal regular tetrahedron of same average edge length
- Skewness: 1 - (min_edge / max_edge), 0=perfect, 1=degenerate
- Jacobian: inscribed/circumscribed sphere ratio vs ideal (sqrt(6)/12)
- Per-cell density tracking: memory_count / 5, total_weight
- BCC decomposition: 216 BCC units → 8000 tetrahedral cells (res=5)

#### HoneycombCellMap
- Global cell index: BCC unit cell → 8 tetrahedra mapping
- Node-to-cell reverse index: which cells contain a given node
- `find_optimal_placement_cells()` — quality + label overlap + density scoring
- `structural_analysis()` — aggregate quality/volume/skewness/Jacobian/density stats
- `get_best_cells()` / `get_cells_by_density()` — top-N cell queries

#### Enhanced Memory Placement
- Tetrahedral quality-aware placement: high-quality cells prioritized
- Label-aware cell scoring: cells near same-label memories get bonus
- Density penalty: over-full cells deprioritized
- Body-center node gets quality bonus (central position in tetrahedron)
- Fallback chain: optimal cells → label-face → label-edge → spatial proximity

#### New API Endpoints (3)
- `GET /api/v1/honeycomb/analysis` — full structural analysis with top cells
- `GET /api/v1/honeycomb/cells` — tetrahedral cells sorted by quality/density
- `GET /api/v1/honeycomb/cells/{node_id}` — cells containing a specific node

#### MCP Tool Server v5.2.0
- 2 new tools: honeycomb_analysis, tetrahedral_cells
- Total: 42 tools

#### Visualization UI
- New "蜂巢结构" (Honeycomb Structure) panel with 7 structural metrics
- Quality/density cell tables with color-coded values

### Changed

- `initialize()` now builds `HoneycombCellMap` after lattice construction
- `stats()` includes `honeycomb_cells` structural analysis section

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added — Self-Organization Engine + Cluster Detection + Entropy Balance + Consolidation + Shortcuts

#### SelfOrganizeEngine
- Unified self-organization engine with four autonomous modules per cycle
- Runs every 180 pulse cycles (configurable via `SELF_ORGANIZE_INTERVAL`)
- `OrganizeResult` — structured report per cycle: clusters, entropy, consolidations, shortcuts

#### Cluster Detection

- Spatial proximity verification: clusters validated by geometric centroid analysis
- `SemanticCluster` data class with cluster_id, labels, node_ids, centroid, avg_weight
- Automatic intra-cluster Hebbian reinforcement for weakly-connected cluster members
- Minimum cluster size = 3 nodes, maximum 8 cluster labels analyzed per cycle

#### Entropy Balance
- Shannon entropy computed over weight distribution (normalized)
- When weight concentration ratio > 5.0 (one node >> average):
  - High-weight nodes suppressed by 10% (weight reflows to system)
  - Low-weight nodes boosted by 20% of average weight
- Preserves total system weight while preventing dominance

#### Memory Consolidation
- Low-weight duplicates (weight < 1.0, similarity >= 65%) automatically merged
- Higher-weight memory absorbs lower-weight memory's weight (60% transfer), labels, activation
- Donor memory marked `__consolidated__` with `consolidated_into` metadata
- Maximum 5 consolidations per cycle to avoid burst disruption
- Hebbian path recorded between consolidator and consolidated

#### Topological Shortcuts
- Virtual connections between semantically close but topologically distant memory pairs
- Criteria: ≥2 shared labels, topological distance 3-6 hops, not already direct neighbors
- Shortcut strength = base * shared_labels / total_unique_labels
- Hebbian path recorded at 2x strength to create lasting bias
- Maximum 3 shortcuts per cycle, 500 total with LRU eviction

#### New API Endpoints (5)
